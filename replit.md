## Overview

Alpha Nex is a comprehensive content management platform that combines user-generated content collection with AI-powered quality assurance and a gamified reward system. The platform allows users to upload various types of content (videos, audio, documents, code, images), review others' submissions, and earn XP points that can be converted to monetary rewards. The system includes sophisticated moderation, KYC verification, and administrative controls.

## Data Flow

### Upload Process
1. User selects file and provides description/category
2. Frontend validates file type, size, and daily quota
3. AI service analyzes content description for quality/duplicates
4. File is securely stored with metadata in database
5. Upload is queued for peer review
6. User receives XP points for successful upload

### Review Process
1. Reviewers are presented with unreviewed content
2. Reviewers rate content as good/bad with detailed feedback
3. Multiple reviews are aggregated for quality scoring
4. Poor quality content may be flagged or removed
5. Reviewers earn XP points for participation
6. Strike system handles reviewer misconduct

### Admin Workflow
1. Administrators monitor user account activity and behavior
2. Review withdrawal requests and process payments
3. Handle user appeals and strike disputes
4. Oversee platform health metrics and user engagement
